                        your manager or superior about this. If you are in a position where you can assign
                        this responsibility to someone, it is highly suggested that you do this immediately.

                    Without an effort, it is not possible to improve cybersecurity in your company. First and foremost, it is crucial that
                    someone in your company is responsible for actively attending this matter. Second, it would be ideal to allocate
                    resources in a way to consistently and regularly work on the necessary tasks like analysing the current state and
                    implementing recommended measures. At last, the responsible person will need time to deepen, update and extend their cybersecurity
                    knowledge in order to understand recommendations and how to implement them in your company. Depending on your goals, it is best
                    to schedule 2-4 hours per week.

                    &lt;p&gt;Passwords are widely used to authenticate a user with a system or application. Therefore, everyone in your

                    &lt;ul&gt;

                    &lt;li&gt;Avoid password/account sharing among employees&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Change shared credentials in off-boarding process&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Store passwords safely (e.g. use a password manager to store and generate passwords)&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Use two-factor authentication (2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA) whenever possible&lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;It should be avoided that employees use the same accounts. In case this is not possible, you need to change
                    such passwords whenever someone should not have access to the protected resource anymore. To this end, you could,
                    for example, add a step in the off-boarding process that reminds you to set new passwords for reused accounts.
                    &lt;strong&gt;To be able to do this, you need a list of all shared accounts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;When you follow best practices like using strong passwords and not reusing passwords, it becomes impossible for
                    most people to remember all these different credentials. As a consequence, you need to start
                    keeping track of credentials in a secure way.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The best way to do this is to use a password manager that stores your passwords in an encrypted container
                    (for example a file). This way, you just need to remember one strong password which is used to access the securely
                    stored passwords. Additionally, most password managers let you generate secure passwords which helps when you need to
                    set up a new account.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;It is much more secure to use a password management solution that does not store your passwords in the cloud or on servers out of your control.
                    On the one hand, the data might not be available to you in case the Internet is not working (if there is no offline-access feature).
                    On the other hand, a data breach could expose your credentials – remember that such services are a worthwhile target for cyber criminals.
                    Try to avoid password manager solutions that allow to manage and view your credentials in a browser (web application).
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                    &lt;strong&gt;Example software that meets this criteria:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://keepass.info"&gt;KeePass2&lt;/a&gt; (Windows),

                    &lt;p&gt;
                    You can synchronize the &lt;strong&gt;encrypted&lt;/strong&gt; archive of your password manager's data with a cloud service
                    to keep everything updated on multiple devices. If you use synchronisation, don't forget to still keep backups which

                    &lt;p&gt;Backups can be used to restore the data if desired, for example in case of data loss, accidental deletion or
                    corruption. In case of a ransomware attack, having a backup is essential to recover your data. It is important that
                    you identify what data is important to your company in order to determine whether it
                    is worth saving. This heavily depends on your business but here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;list of customers and suppliers&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;personnel records&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;administration documents&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;contracts and insurance policies&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;business plans and marketing material&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;credentials (usernames and passwords)&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;software licenses&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;financial data&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;payment recipes and account statements&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;tax-related documents&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;inventory records&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make an accurate list of all important data your company has stored.
                    Also write down precisely where this data is stored.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Please note that &lt;em&gt;replication/synchronisation&lt;/em&gt; is not the same as a
                    &lt;em&gt;backup&lt;/em&gt; because replicated/synchronised data is updated continuously. This means that most likely
                    there is no history of the data. Consequently, it might not be possible to restore deleted files. In contrast, a backup
                    is a basically the state of the data at a certain point in time and can be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Try to automate your backups, so you do not need to do it this manually. On the one hand, this saves you time
                    that can be invested to further improve cybersecurity at your company. On the other hand, it assures that the backups
                    are not accidentally forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;It is important to check regularly if the backups are actually being made according to the set schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt; It could be that your primary backup gets compromised and will no longer be usable. There could be many
                    reasons for this, such as theft of both, the backup and the original data, environmental hazards affecting both
                    systems or malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, you should have at least two backups in different physical locations. For example, the second
                    copy could be stored encrypted in a cloud-based service. For very small businesses, the second copy could just be
                    taken home by the owner and rotated once per week.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Don't forget to properly secure external storage drives with encryption and by physically locking
                    them away appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

                    server (more complicated setup for larger businesses). Avoid the vulnerable WEP standard as it is fundamentally broken.
                    Also note that just hiding your network by not broadcasting your network name (SSID) does not sufficiently

                    &lt;p&gt;Generally, users should always lock systems when they are leaving the system unattended. Locking your computers
                    after a period of inactivity can prevent others from using the logged in account in case the last user forgot to lock or log off
                    the workstation. Note that just showing a screensaver that can be stopped without providing a password or PIN is not
                    considered secure.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Most operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, ...) can be configured to lock when the session is inactive
                    for some minutes. Even mobile devices like smartphones or tables (iOS, Android, ...) have this feature.
                    Consult the documentation or manual of your systems to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;There might be some systems where it is not possible to enforce this rule. In these cases, make sure that
                    the unattended system does not allow access to sensitive information or other systems/resources you want to have
                    protected.&lt;/p&gt;
